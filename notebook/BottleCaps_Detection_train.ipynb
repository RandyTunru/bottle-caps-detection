        "With the constraint of running the models in an edge device (Raspberry Pi 5) within a 5-10ms target, we are limiting our experiments to the smallest parameter models of each major YOLO version, specifically the \"nano\" variants. A 5-10ms (100-200 FPS) target is extremely aggressive and will likely require post-training quantization (e.g., to INT8) and a highly optimized inference runtime (like ONNX or TFLite).\n",
